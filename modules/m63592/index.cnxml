<content><para id="eip-192">Welcome to <emphasis effect="italics">Elementary Algebra</emphasis>, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.</para><section id="eip-287"><title>About OpenStax</title><para id="eip-634">OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. Our adaptive learning technology, designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized educational paths, is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</para></section><section id="eip-328"><title>About OpenStax Resources</title><section id="eip-583"><title>Customization</title><para id="eip-912"><emphasis effect="italics">Elementary Algebra</emphasis> is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which means that you can distribute, remix, and build upon the content, as long as you provide attribution to OpenStax and its content contributors.</para><para id="eip-706">Because our books are openly licensed, you are free to use the entire book or pick and choose the sections that are most relevant to the needs of your course. Feel free to remix the content by assigning your students certain chapters and sections in your syllabus, in the order that you prefer. You can even provide a direct link in your syllabus to the sections in the web view of your book.</para><para id="eip-740">Instructors also have the option of creating a customized version of their OpenStax book.

However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on openstax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on openstax.org.</para></section><section id="eip-674"><title>Format</title><para id="eip-232">You can access this textbook for free in web view or PDF through openstax.org, and for a low cost in print.</para></section></section><section id="eip-574"><title>About <emphasis effect="italics">Elementary Algebra</emphasis></title><para id="eip-203"><emphasis effect="italics">Elementary Algebra</emphasis> is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of a one-semester elementary algebra course. The book’s organization makes it easy to adapt to a variety of course syllabi. The text expands on the fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.</para><section id="eip-95"><title>Coverage and Scope</title><para id="eip-974"><emphasis effect="italics">Elementary Algebra</emphasis> follows a nontraditional approach in its presentation of content. Building on the content in <emphasis effect="italics">Prealgebra</emphasis>, the material is presented as a sequence of small steps so that students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course. The order of topics was carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression through the course and to facilitate a thorough understanding of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.</para><list id="eip-992"><item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 1: Foundations</emphasis><newline/>
Chapter 1 reviews arithmetic operations with whole numbers, integers, fractions, and decimals, to give the student a solid base that will support their study of algebra.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 2: Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities</emphasis><newline/>
In Chapter 2, students learn to verify a solution of an equation, solve equations using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality, solve equations using the Multiplication and Division Properties of Equality, solve equations with variables and constants on both sides, use a general strategy to solve linear equations, solve equations with fractions or decimals, solve a formula for a specific variable, and solve linear inequalities.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 3: Math Models</emphasis><newline/>
Once students have learned the skills needed to solve equations, they apply these skills in Chapter 3 to solve word and number problems.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 4: Graphs</emphasis><newline/>
Chapter 4 covers the rectangular coordinate system, which is the basis for most consumer graphs. Students learn to plot points on a rectangular coordinate system, graph linear equations in two variables, graph with intercepts, understand slope of a line, use the slope-intercept form of an equation of a line, find the equation of a line, and create graphs of linear inequalities.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 5: Systems of Linear Equations</emphasis><newline/>
Chapter 5 covers solving systems of equations by graphing, substitution, and elimination; solving applications with systems of equations, solving mixture applications with systems of equations, and graphing systems of linear inequalities.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 6: Polynomials</emphasis><newline/>
In Chapter 6, students learn how to add and subtract polynomials, use multiplication properties of exponents, multiply polynomials, use special products, divide monomials and polynomials, and understand integer exponents and scientific notation.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 7: Factoring</emphasis><newline/>
In Chapter 7, students explore the process of factoring expressions and see how factoring is used to solve certain types of equations.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 8: Rational Expressions and Equations</emphasis><newline/>
In Chapter 8, students work with rational expressions, solve rational equations, and use them to solve problems in a variety of applications.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 9: Roots and Radical</emphasis><newline/>
In Chapter 9, students are introduced to and learn to apply the properties of square roots, and extend these concepts to higher order roots and rational exponents.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Chapter 10: Quadratic Equations</emphasis><newline/>
In Chapter 10, students study the properties of quadratic equations, solve and graph them. They also learn how to apply them as models of various situations.</item>

Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.</para><para id="fs-id1171789942703">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we show students how to check the solution. Most Examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.</para><para id="fs-id1171789686229"><emphasis effect="bold">Be Prepared!</emphasis> Each section, beginning with Section 2.1, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can determine if they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from previous sections so students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be found in the supplemental resources that accompany this title.</para>

<media id="fs-id1171782146065" alt="This figure shows three x y-coordinate planes. The first plane shows two lines which intersect at one point. Under the graph it says, “The lines intersect. Intersecting lines have one point in common. There is one solution to this system.” The second x y-coordinate plane shows two parallel lines. Under the graph it says, “The lines are parallel. Parallel lines have no points in common. There is no solution to this system.” The third x y-coordinate plane shows one line. Under the graph it says, “Both equations give the same line. Because we have just one line, there are infinitely many solutions.">
