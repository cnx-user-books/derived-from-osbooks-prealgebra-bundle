  <para id="fs-id2052202">Imagine placing a plant in the ground one day and finding that it has doubled its height just a few days later. Although it may seem incredible, this can happen with certain types of bamboo species. These members of the grass family are the fastest-growing plants in the world. One species of bamboo has been observed to grow nearly 1.5 inches every hour. <footnote id="fs-id1586918">http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/fastest-growing-plant/</footnote> In a twenty-four hour period, this bamboo plant grows about 36 inches, or an incredible 3 feet! A constant rate of change, such as the growth cycle of this bamboo plant, is a linear function.</para>
  
  <para id="fs-id2058024">Recall from <link class="target-chapter" document="m51261">Functions and Function Notation</link> that a function is a relation that assigns to every element in the domain exactly one element in the range. Linear functions are a specific type of function that can be used to model many real-world applications, such as plant growth over time. In this chapter, we will explore linear functions, their graphs, and how to relate them to data.</para>
